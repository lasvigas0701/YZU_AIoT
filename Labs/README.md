|--|--|--|
|lab02|RPi GPIO|Change the blinking time of a LED light by pressing a button one time.
|lab03|PWM & UART|Control the tone of buzzer and brightness of LED by the serial input from computer.
|lab04|I2C SPI IMU|Adjust the brightness of the LED according to the tilt angle (y-axis) of the accelerometer, and turn on or turn off the LED when a rapid rotation along the z-axis is detected while the module is placed on the table.
|lab05|Camera|Push button one time to rotate the image 45 degrees clockwise.
|lab06|CV on RPi|Monitor the lower right quadrant. If an object is detected (the bounding box of the object is fully included in the lower right quadrant.), show a red rectangle on the lower right quadrant, and turn a LED on for more than 3 seconds.
|lab07|Health Promotion|Count the cycles from Biceps Curl to Lateral Raise with camera and image recognition.
|lab08|Health Promotion2|Count the cycles from Biceps Curl to Lateral Raise with accelerometer.
|lab09|Autonomous Car|Put the detected object at the center of the captured images by letting a sample car turn right, turn left or move forward or backward.
|lab11|Smart Speaker|Turn the LED on (resp. off) when you say “開燈” (resp. "關燈") and output an audio "燈已開啟" (resp. "燈已關閉").

The number of all labs is 13, but there is no python code with lab01, lab10, lab12 and lab13.
